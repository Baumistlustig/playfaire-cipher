The playfaire cipher in different languages

I created this repo because of the NSA challange. Every language contains an encrypt and decrypt function.

## Description

The Playfair cipher or Playfair square or Wheatstoneâ€“Playfair cipher is a manual symmetric encryption technique and was the first literal digram substitution cipher. The scheme was invented in 1854 by Charles Wheatstone, but bears the name of Lord Playfair for promoting its use. [[Wiki](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Playfair_cipher)]
